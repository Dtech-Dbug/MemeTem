# Meme Templates Repository

Welcome to the Meme Templates Repository! 🚀

This project aims to be a **one-stop destination for all meme templates and memes**. The goal is to build a comprehensive collection that anyone can contribute to and use. We welcome contributors of all levels to help make this project even better! 🙌 

Currently the templates are scraped from this source : `https://imgflip.com/memetemplates`

## How You Can Contribute:

### 1. **UI Styles** 🎨
   - We want to improve the look and feel of the project! Help us refine and create better UI styles that will enhance user experience.

### 2. **Documentation** 📝
   - The current documentation can be improved. We'd love your help in writing better docs for newcomers, users, and contributors alike!

### 3. **Scraping Links** 🔗
   - Right now, we are using static links to render images. If you can help us scrape better sources for meme images or find efficient ways to manage links (without a backend), we'd greatly appreciate it!

## Vision Board 🌟

- **Meme Section**: In the future, we plan to have a dedicated section for actual memes.
- **Categories**: Adding categories to organize memes better is part of our long-term goal.

Let's build something fun together! Feel free to contribute, give feedback, or share your thoughts with us. 😄

## For Devs & Contributers 🧑🏻‍💻
- To Use the scrappers, you need this **`server.js file.`**  
- First Initialize a Backend in **`Nodejs`**
- Then Paste this **`server.js`** file as Main file in place of **`index.js file.`**
- Now You can run the Backend and Use **`pMemeScrapper.js file`** to run scrapper and extract mems in a **`JSON format`**
- **`DO NOT` Try to `Remove Any ERROR`** in **`server.js file`**. These are not error, Actually these are warnings and **can be Ignored.**
