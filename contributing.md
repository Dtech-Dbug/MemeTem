# Contributing to Meme Template Repository

We welcome contributions of all kinds! To make the process easy for everyone, please follow the guidelines below:

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Fork the Repo**  
   Start by forking the repository, then clone it to your local machine.

2. **Create a Branch**  
   Always branch off from `main` or `master`.  
   Name your feature branch using the format `task-contributor`, e.g., `update-docs-henry` or `UI-styles-john-doe`.

3. **Raise a Pull Request (PR)**  
   When you're ready, raise a PR to `main` or `master` for review and eventual merge.

4. **Contributing to Static Links (for Meme Templates)**  
   If you plan to contribute by adding static links to meme templates, please edit the file `Data/index.js`.

## Good First-Time Issues

If you're new to the project, here are some good first-time issues to start with:

- **Refine the UI**  
  Add some artistic flair to improve the user experience.

- **Add Download Provision to Meme Templates**  
  Currently, when we click on meme templates, the background blurs. It should also display a download icon in the center to allow users to download the meme.

- **Add a Splash Screen**  
  Create a splash screen that gives users a brief overview of the app and redirects them to the main feed. This can be either automatic (after a certain timeout) or with a manual Call to Action (CTA).
